The texts and display will be very small if the resolution is too high on Windows. One way to fix this is to change the system scaling. Yet some software will still stay the same.

To solve this, right click on the ***exe*** file, choose **Properties**, click the **Compatibility** tab -> **Change high DPI settings**, select **Override high DPI scaling behavior**, scaling performed by **System (Enhanced)**.
